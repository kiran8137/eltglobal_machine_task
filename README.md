 # Book App

 This application is a simple Flutter-based app with three main screens and a sub-screen for book details. It demonstrates user authentication, book listing, author information, and a rating system. The app is built using Flutter and BLoC for state management, with navigation handled using go_router.


 **Screens**

## Authentication Screen
+ Register using a username, password, and confirm password.
+ JWT Token Management:
    - Store JWT token using shared_preferences.
    - Maintain user's logged-in status.
    - Direct navigation to the Home Screen upon reopening the app if the user is authenticated.
